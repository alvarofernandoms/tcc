 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
   The Mezuro is a free \textit{Web} platform evaluation of source code. Since
   metrics can be defined as measures of various features of a software, Mezuro
   evaluates the static metrics of projects developed in certain languages.
   These metrics are exposed through numbers and readings groups, exposing the
   user aspects of size and quality of their project by simply inform the URL of
   the remote version control system. The objective of this study is to perform
   an exploratory analysis of this tool, addressing aspects of visualization of
   the software code metrics analyzed by it.
