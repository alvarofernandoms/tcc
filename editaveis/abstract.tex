\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
   The Mezuro is a free web platform evaluation of source code. The metrics are
   exposed through numbers and readings groups. The objective of this work is
   to evolve the visualization of metrics code of the software analyzed by
   Mezuro. As a scientific contribution, or research activity, the study of
   possible software visualization techniques and their combination with the
   source code metrics will be contemplated. And as technological activity will
   be proposed to display a set of specific metrics, evolve of the Mezuro's
   metric configurations and will be proposed a contribution to the maintainers
   of this platform.
